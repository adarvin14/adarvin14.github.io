Officially 2 months into this bootcamp, we have been tasked with creating a web application using Active Record and Sinatra.  With the pace of this course and the difficulty that comes with learnning code, (something that has been nearly completely unfamiliar to me until I enrolled in this program) I feel a true sense of pride and accomplishment in the amount of knowledge I have gained and the work that I have done.  With this project we have our first real-world application of our skills and knowledge to create an application that works in a web browser.  2 months ago, I could not even imagine coding something that anyone could access in their web browser, let alone learning all of this complicated code that would have looked like gibberish to me at the start.  Of course, building this project was not easy. Troubleshooting errors and scouring through my code for the tiniest mistake could take me hours to resolve, and oftentimes I think so much about my errors that I lose track of where I should be looking.  If there's one thing this project taught me, it's to calm down and look at your code carefully, because the mistakes you make can be the ones that are so obvious you wouldn't even think of them.  Coding this project itself took much less time compared to my Object Oriented Ruby project, but executing the code to run the application properly was much more challenging in comparison, since it involves both Ruby and HTML, which was a little confusing to me while learning Sinatra and coding my project.  Overall, I'm pleased with the result and have a true sense of accomplishment with the work that I have done.
