Learning Ruby on Rails has been one of the more complicated units, but actually somewhat simpler in the amount of new code we've had to learn for the creation of our Rails applications.  Sinatra was the basic web browser application that was more of an introduction to the code we would use in Rails as opposed to its own entire unit.  Rails builds and expands on the concepts we learned in Sinatra, allowing us to create more intricate and complex web browser applications.  It is really amazing being able to build these kinds of applications and seeing how the code we write translates directly to a web page (or collection of web pages) that can be easily navigated by anyone who knows how to use the internet. Having a tangible and realistic application is honestly awesome, and navigating through the application myself amazes me.  3 months ago, I could not even imagine being able to create a working application in a web browser, and it really demonstrates how important this kind of coding is in nearly every persons life since everyone and their grandmother uses the internet.  This is the first project where my sense of accomplishment translates directly into the feeling of being capable of coding these kinds of applications for a job.  I'm excited to learn javascript and the other coding programs, and being able to expand my options as a potential candidate for employment as I learn.
