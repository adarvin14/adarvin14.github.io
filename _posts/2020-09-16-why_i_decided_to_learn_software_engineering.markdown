When I was a freshman in highschool, I imagined that when I turned 23 i would be walking down the streets of New York in a suit and tie going to my job as either a generic businessman or an architect.  Fast forward to the my college graduation when I'm recieving my degree in Environmental Studies and wondering what opportunities await me outside of school.  After spending the summer recovering from ACL surgery, I finally found a job working as a field sampler for an environmental consulting company.  As interesting as the job was, I rarely worked more than 5-6 hours a day, and my pay was less than desirable.  I left that job shortly after finding a new job working for another environmental company specializing in hazardous waste disposal.  As interesting as that job was, it wasn't a job I wanted to make a career out of.  After the COVID outbreak started, I was furloughed and looking for something to do.  Finding a job was difficult due to the epidemic and I needed something to keep me occupied while I'm waiting for businesses to open up again.  That was when I heard about a friend of mine starting the Flatiron School Software Engineering Program.  Computer programming has always been interesting to me since it is what drives many of our technologies these days.  It is such a versatile skill that can be used for practically any business, and learning it would give me so many more options for the kind of job I want and where I want to work.  Not only do I believe learning coding would get me a good job, but also gives me the knowledge to work on my own creative endeavors.  As challenging as this course may be, I believe that this is what I need to make the next step in my career.
