As I am writing this, I have nearly reached the end of this program being roughly 4 weeks away from finishing.  Having learned so much about the coding languages that I have went through in this program, javascript is an interesting language.  In comparison to ruby and html language, it seems the most abstract to me.  Sometimes concepts were difficult to grasp.  Personally, it was the least interesting unit to me, but also the most useful of all the units I have learned so far.  Don't get me wrong, I still enoyed learning javascript; learning how to manipulate elements on a page is really cool and learning how to use a Rails API to display that information stored in a databse using javascript is incredible.  However, I cannot create my own javascript application using only javascript.  If I wanted to make an application that is detailed and useful, it would also require me to use Ruby code in order to function similarly to my Rails application.  I understand that every unit in this bootcamp builds on the last, so it would only make sense that a single unit of this course is not super useful on its own aside from Rails.  I think it may be because javascript is the unit that I have really spent the least amount of time really learning, or maybe just had the most trouble learning, but understanding that the javascript frontend's purpose is to make processing and displaying infromation from the backend easier means that I will have to spend more time with it.  I will look forward to seeing what else I can learn in javascript as I prepare for using this knowldge entering the working world.
